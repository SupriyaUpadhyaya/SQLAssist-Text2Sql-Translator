# Google Colab Notebooks

The training and inference was performed using the FastLangaugeModel module from unsloth🦥 library which accelerates the training and inference by 2 fold. 

We have fine-tuned the open-source 🦙Llama-3-8b 4 bit quantized model optimized for finetuning provided by unsloth.

##
### Training Dataset
Our selection was trained on [Clinton/Text-to-sql-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Clinton/Text-to-sql-v1) dataset with 262,208 instances. It is composed of multiple datasets like wikiSQL, sql-create-context, nvbench, mimicsql-data, squall, mimic-iii, sede, eicu, spider, atis and advising.
